# Amethyst Stealer - Preliminary Threat Intelligence Report

## Executive Summary

Amethyst Stealer is a relatively new information-stealing malware written in .NET, identified in early 2024 and sold as Malware-as-a-Service (MaaS) on Telegram. This malware focuses on exfiltrating sensitive user information such as browser data, credentials, and session tokens from Discord, Telegram, and Chromium-based browsers. Despite its increasing popularity, public information and analysis remain limited at the time of writing.

This mini report summarizes current findings and provides temporary recommendations for detection and mitigation. Due to the lack of sufficient indicators and behavioral data, the investigation of Amethyst Stealer will be paused until further samples and infrastructure can be analyzed.

## Malware Summary

* **Name**: Amethyst Stealer
* **Type**: Information Stealer
* **Language**: .NET
* **Delivery Method**: Droppers, cracked software, fake installers
* **Steals**:

  * Discord and Telegram tokens
  * Saved credentials and autofill data from browsers

## Current Indicators of Compromise (IoCs)

* **Hash**:

  * SHA256: `4149b07d9fdcd04b34efa0a64e47a1b9581ff9d1f670ea552b7c93fb66199b5f`

## YARA Detection

A custom YARA rule was crafted specifically for this Amethyst Stealer sample. The rule is designed to detect static characteristics of the .NET-compiled binary, including references to .NET assemblies and custom encoded strings. Due to the use of obfuscation and frequent repacking by threat actors, **hash-based detection is unreliable**, and dynamic detection strategies are recommended.

## Recommendations

* Use the custom `amethyst.yar` detection rule in internal retro-hunt systems or YARA-compatible scanners.
* Employ behavioral firewalls and network monitoring tools like **GlassWire**, configured with **VirusTotal API integration**, to flag suspicious outbound communications.
* Avoid relying solely on antivirus products such as Windows Defender, as Amethyst has shown the ability to evade basic heuristics.
* Monitor .NET binaries for suspicious assembly loads or excessive string obfuscation.

## Status

The current investigation is **on hold** until more telemetry, execution traces, or updated samples become available.
